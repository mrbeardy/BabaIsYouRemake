# Baba is You Remake

Baba is you is a top-down puzzle game. The game centers around the manipulation
of "rules" — represented by tiles with words written on them — in order to allow
the titular character Baba (or some other object) to reach a specified goal.

## Gameplay

The player, usually, controls a character known as Baba, with exceptions in some
levels. Each level contains various movable word tiles, corresponding to
specific types of objects and obstacles on the field (such as Baba itself, the
goal flag, walls and environmental hazards, and other creatures), linking
operators such as "is" and "and", and verb tiles reflecting the properties of
these objects (such as "you", which makes the object become controlled by the
player, "push" to make them movable, "stop" to make them impassable, "win" to
specify the goal, "sink" to make items drown in it, and so on). The objective of
each level is for the player to reach the goal by manipulating these tiles to
create or modify "rules" by which they behave. For example, the goal can be
changed by moving "is" and "win" blocks to another object, and the player can
travel through objects by removing the "stop" trait from them.

Levels can force specific rules by placing their blocks in a corner, so they
cannot be moved.
